## Features

- **Single Click**: Save the current text from the input field to the browser's local storage. If there is already saved content for that URL, it will paste that content into the input field.
- **Double Click**: Append the saved text to whatever text is currently in the input field, ensuring efficient reuse of prompts.
- **Right Click**: Access a context menu with options to clear all saved texts and navigate to the GitHub page for the extension.

## How to Use

1. **Single Click**: 
   - If there's text in the input field, it will be saved to the browser's local storage for the current URL.
   - If the input field is empty and there's already saved data associated with the current URL, that data will be retrieved from local storage and inserted into the input field.

2. **Double Click**: 
   - This will always append the saved text from local storage to the input field below the current content, with an empty line before the appended text.

3. **Right Click**:
   - **Clear All Saved Data**: Clears all saved data from the local storage.
   - **Go to GitHub Page**: Navigates to the GitHub page for the extension.
